How do I approach designing software?

-When I begin designing software, I take a systematic approach and plan the final result before I create any code. This project strengthened my design philosophy, especially since I am new to designing 3D spaces and environments. I learned about how vital it is to plan ahead to properly organize objects, adjust the lighting of the scene, and ensure the textures look good before applying them to the project. My design process included testing and debugging during the creation process for constant feedback of how my overall scene appeared, especially with the more complex objects like the fridge or the window of the scene.

How do I approach developing programs?

During this project, I emphasized trial and error to ensure my objects were the correct size and shape. I debugged and tested my project very often by changing angles, lightingm and object placement until I was happy with the results. My coding became more structured as I had correct objects and lighting within the scene, requiring minor changes as I developed the code.

How can computer science help me in reaching my goals?

Computer Science can help me to reach my goals by instilling creativity and logic together to understand how math and programming can be used to create passion projects such as this one. These skills will be vital to me in the future by establishing problem solving skills and attention to detail, which will be vital in my journey through the Cyberspace workforce, and can be translated to other fields such as game design, which is an endeavor I may pursue in the future.
